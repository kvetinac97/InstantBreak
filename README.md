# InstantBreak
<i>Tap and break!</i>

InstantBreak is PocketMine-MP plugin

<h4>How it works?</h4>

<h5>1) Put this plugin into /plugins file <br>
2) Give users this permissions: </h5>
  a) ib
   (allow command /ib-on, command /ib-off, using InstantBreak - silktouch/touch and breaking Bedrock)<br>
  b) ib.command
   (allow commands /ib-on and /ib-off)<br>
  c) ib.command.on (allow only command /ib-on; gives you Silktouch and Touch Item & Enables InstantBreaking)<br>
  d) ib.command.off (allow only command /ib-off; removes SilkTouch and Touch Item & Disables InstantBreaking)<br>
  e) ib.use (allow InstantBreaking blocks - silktouch/touch)<br>
  f) ib.use.silktouch (allow only InstantBreaking blocks with silktouch)<br>
  g) ib.use.touch (allow only InstantBreaking blocks with touch)<br>
  h) ib.unbreakable (allow breaking blocks
  d) ib (for command /ib-on, /ib-off and for using)
  
<h5>3) Login to your server and: </h5>

  a) type /ib-on and get silktouch & touch items<br>
  b) Players can't enable InstantBreaking without command /ib-on (they obtain items with crafting)
  c) Just tap/start breaking blocks (with those items) what you want to destroy<br>
  
<h5>4)  Blocks you tap/start breaking will be destroyed and it drops just the block you destroyed (on silktouch)         or drops set in drops.yml (by default there are written normal block drops) </h5>
