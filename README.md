InstantBreak by @kvetinac97
======================================
«Tap and break!»

InstantBreak is PocketMine-MP plugin
How it works?
1) Put this plugin into /plugins file
2) Give users this permissions:

a) ib (allow command /ib-on, command /ib-off, using InstantBreak - silktouch/touch and breaking Bedrock)
b) ib.command (allow commands /ib-on and /ib-off)
c) ib.command.on (allow only command /ib-on; gives you Silktouch and Touch Item & Enables InstantBreaking)
d) ib.command.off (allow only command /ib-off; removes SilkTouch and Touch Item & Disables InstantBreaking)
e) ib.use (allow InstantBreaking blocks - silktouch/touch)
f) ib.use.silktouch (allow only InstantBreaking blocks with silktouch)
g) ib.use.touch (allow only InstantBreaking blocks with touch)
h) ib.unbreakable (allow breaking blocks d) ib (for command /ib-on, /ib-off and for using)

3) Login to your server and:

a) type /ib-on and get silktouch & touch items
b) Players can't enable InstantBreaking without command /ib-on (they obtain items with crafting) c) Just tap/start breaking blocks (with those items) what you want to destroy
4) Blocks you tap/start breaking will be destroyed and it drops just the block you destroyed (on silktouch) or drops set in drops.yml (by default there are written normal block drops)
